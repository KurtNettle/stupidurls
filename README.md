# stupidurls
A personal collection of stupid urls which redricts users to various ads/downloads malicious files/pops up shit and other malicous things. Basically these are the websites which mislead user.
You might find most of the urls are sites which are like software crack/patches distributer. I personally don't encourage you to do piracy also I ain't responsible for your deeds.
My aim of making my personal collection public is to keep users safe accross the globe.
